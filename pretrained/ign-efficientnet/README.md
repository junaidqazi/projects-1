# IGN-EfficientNet

EfficientNet Tensorflow from https://github.com/qubvel/efficientnet

**This directory is very lack of comments, understand Tensorflow, Tensorflow estimator, Tensorflow Dataset really helpful**.

## Objective

1. Provide pretrained ConvNext image segmentation for https://github.com/koechslin/swin-transformer-semantic-segmentation dataset.

And make sure put bias on the dataset, https://github.com/koechslin/swin-transformer-semantic-segmentation#information-on-the-training
